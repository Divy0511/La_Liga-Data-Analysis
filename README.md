## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Steps followed to generate the predictions and insights:

1. **Data Collection**

   * Gathered La Liga results data from the last **11 seasons (2014‚Äì2025)**.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Formatted results tables
   * Removed inconsistencies (e.g., promoted/relegated clubs)
   * Ensured consistent columns for points, wins, losses, goals, etc.

3. **Statistical Analysis**

   * Calculated **average requirements** for each league outcome (Winner, Top 4, Europa League, Conference League, Relegation survival).
   * Metrics included **points, win %, and points per match**.

4. **Pattern Identification**

   * Identified recurring performance thresholds for success (e.g., \~90 points needed to win, \~71 for Top 4).

5. **Prediction Modeling**

   * Applied derived benchmarks to **forecast 25/26 season outcomes** for each team.

Would you like me to also **include visuals/graphs from the notebook** (like bar plots of win % or points requirements) in the README, or keep it text + tables only?
